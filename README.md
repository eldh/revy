# Revy

A higher order design system for ReasonReact.

## What?

Revy is a tool for building design systems in ReasonReact. It consists of a theme generator, some base components and a number of utils for working with styling, colors, layout, spacing etc.

The goal is to make it easy to build accessible, performant and beautiful ReasonReact components.

## Getting started

- Run `yarn` in the repo root.
- Run `yarn start` in the `revy` folder to compile the main project.
- Run `yarn start` in the `demo` folder to start the demo server.
- Explore the demo app at `demo/src/App.re`.

## Status

Pre-alpha. Still figuring out the details. No docs as of yet.

## Todos

- Better high level color utils (makeReadable, mix, tint, etc)
- Motion stuff
- Elevation helpers (box-shadow etc)
- Perf improvments
- More components
- Figure out separation between theming and component library
